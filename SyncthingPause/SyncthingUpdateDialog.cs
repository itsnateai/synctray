/// Modal dialog for upgrading the Syncthing daemon. Shown by SettingsForm's
/// "Check Now" button when GET /rest/system/upgrade reports a newer version.
///
/// Flow:
///   1. Display "Update available: vRUNNING -> vLATEST" with [Upgrade Now] [Cancel].
///   2. On Upgrade Now: POST /rest/system/upgrade (Syncthing downloads + restarts itself).
///   3. Poll GET /rest/system/version every 1s for up to 60s.
///   4. When `version` flips away from the pre-upgrade running value -> success,
///      label flips to "Upgraded to vNEW!", button changes to Close, fire toast.
///   5. On timeout -> warn: daemon hasn't come back, ask user to check tray.
///
/// What this dialog does NOT do (and why):
///   - No GitHub call: Syncthing's own /rest/system/upgrade is the upgrade trigger.
///   - No hash verification: Syncthing's upgrade-fetcher does its own signature check.
///   - No file swap / .old / .new dance: the daemon swaps its own binary atomically.
///   - No crash sentinel: failure surfaces as the next poll-tick reporting timeout,
///     not as a torn binary for SyncthingPause to recover.
///
/// The visual layout (FixedDialog, dark palette, marquee progress, two-button row)
/// matches UpdateDialog so users see one upgrade UX across "SyncthingPause updates
/// itself" and "Syncthing daemon updates itself".
