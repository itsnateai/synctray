# SyncthingPause

*Pause Syncthing from your tray. One click. Resume when you're done.*

A lightweight Windows tray companion for [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), built with C# (.NET 8 WinForms). Launches Syncthing hidden, shows sync state in the icon, and gives you one-click pause/resume — that's the headline feature; everything else exists to support it.

> **Renamed from SyncthingTray (v2.x).** v3.0.0 is the same project, refocused around its actual usage pattern (pause when you need bandwidth) and renamed to avoid confusion with [Martchus's Syncthing Tray](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray) (the well-known Qt cross-platform tray app). Existing v2.x installs continue working; see [Migration](#migration-from-syncthingtray-v2x) below.

## Features

- **One-click pause/resume** via menu, middle-click, or timed pause (5 min, 30 min, until resumed)
- **Per-folder and per-device pause** with partial-pause icon when not everything is paused
- Launches Syncthing hidden (no console window)
- Tray icon shows running state (sync / partial-pause / pause) with dark-themed context menu
- Start, stop, and restart Syncthing from the tray menu
- Open the Syncthing Web UI with a double-click
- Synced Folders submenu — open any synced folder in Explorer
- Device connect/disconnect notifications
- File conflict (pull error) detection
- Network auto-pause on public networks (WMI-based)
- Auto-update check for Syncthing (daily, rate-limited)
- Dark-themed Settings GUI with discovery toggles
- Config check utility (validates exe, process, API, discovery)
- Help window with usage guide
- Graceful shutdown via Syncthing REST API with process kill fallback
- Crash detection with audible alert when Syncthing exits unexpectedly
- Run at Windows startup (shortcut in Startup folder)
- Portable mode — auto-detected on removable drives (disables startup shortcut)
- First-run wizard — auto-opens Settings when no config exists
- Overclick safeguard — cooldown on rapid Start/Stop/Restart/Pause actions
- Single-instance enforcement — kills previous instances on launch
- Tray icon recovery after Explorer restarts

## Download

Grab the latest from the [Releases](https://github.com/itsnateai/syncthingpause/releases) page:

- **`SyncthingPause.exe`** — self-contained, no .NET runtime needed (~147 MB)

### WinGet

```powershell
winget install itsnateai.SyncthingPause
```

WinGet installs stay current automatically — use `winget upgrade itsnateai.SyncthingPause`. The in-app self-update button detects WinGet installs and points you back at the CLI instead of trying to overwrite the managed binary.

> If you previously installed `itsnateai.SyncthingTray`, see [Migration](#migration-from-syncthingtray-v2x) — the WinGet PackageIdentifier changed with the rename, so `winget upgrade` won't carry you across versions automatically.

### Self-update integrity

Releases publish a `SHA256SUMS` file alongside the exe. The in-app **Update** button downloads it, verifies the hash, and fails closed if anything is missing or doesn't match. Unverified updates never land on disk.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases) — download `syncthing-windows-amd64-*.zip` and extract `syncthing.exe`

> **Note:** This is a lightweight alternative to [Martchus's Syncthing Tray](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray) (Qt-based, ~80 MB) — that one's the established cross-platform Syncthing tray app with built-in file browser and embedded web view. SyncthingPause focuses on the single thing most users actually open the tray for: pausing Syncthing when you need bandwidth.

## Setup

1. Download `SyncthingPause.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/itsnateai/syncthingpause/releases)
2. Download [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases) and extract `syncthing.exe` to the same folder
3. Run `SyncthingPause.exe` — Syncthing starts automatically in the background
4. Right-click the tray icon > **Settings** to enter your API key

## Configuration

Right-click the tray icon and select **Settings** to configure:

- **Double-click action** — configurable: Open Web UI, Force Rescan, Pause/Resume, or Do Nothing
- **Middle-click action** — configurable: same options as double-click
- **Run on startup** — creates/removes a Windows Startup shortcut
- **Start browser** — open the Web UI when Syncthing launches
- **Sound notifications** — play sounds on device connect/disconnect, file errors, unexpected stop
- **Auto-pause on public networks** — pause syncing on public Wi-Fi
- **Startup delay** — wait N seconds before launching Syncthing
- **Syncthing path** — custom path to `syncthing.exe`
- **Web UI URL** — custom Syncthing Web UI address
- **API Key** — required for pause/resume, status polling, and graceful shutdown. Find it in the Syncthing Web UI under Actions > Settings > API Key.
- **Discovery** — toggle Global Discovery, Local Discovery, and NAT Traversal
- **Auto-update** — check for Syncthing updates daily

Settings are saved to `SyncthingPause.ini` in the application directory.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostic logging is **off by default**. To enable it, add `DiagnosticLogging=1` to `SyncthingPause.ini`. When enabled, a rolling log is written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SyncthingPause\tray.log` (1 MB cap, one-generation rotation to `.1`) — attach this file to any bug report.

## Migration from SyncthingTray (v2.x)

SyncthingPause v3.0.0 was previously released as `SyncthingTray` v2.x. The rename comes with a migration bridge so existing users carry their state forward without manual steps:

- **Pause state** — `pause.dat` is auto-migrated from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SyncthingTray\` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SyncthingPause\` on first launch (Copy → verify → delete legacy). The 22-folder paused state from v2.x users survives the upgrade transparently.
- **Settings** — if `SyncthingTray.ini` is co-located with the new exe, it's one-shot copied to `SyncthingPause.ini`. The legacy file is preserved for rollback.
- **Startup shortcut** — any `SyncthingTray.lnk` in your Startup folder is removed on first launch so old and new don't both auto-launch and fight over `syncthing.exe`.
- **Running predecessor** — any running `SyncthingTray.exe` in your session is killed at SyncthingPause startup so it releases its `pause.dat` lock before migration runs.

### Manual cleanup after v3.0.0 verifies cleanly
- `winget uninstall itsnateai.SyncthingTray` (the rename predecessor stays in WinGet's manifest registry as a deprecated package; users running `winget upgrade` are pointed at the new ID)
- Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SyncthingTray\` once you've confirmed pause state migrated

## Uninstall

1. Right-click the tray icon → **Exit**
2. Delete `SyncthingPause.exe` and `SyncthingPause.ini`
3. Delete `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\SyncthingPause.lnk` if you enabled "Run on startup"
4. Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SyncthingPause\` (contains the diagnostic log, pause state, and update sentinel)
5. If installed via WinGet: `winget uninstall itsnateai.SyncthingPause`

Syncthing itself is separate — uninstall it via whatever method you used to install it.

## Building from Source

Requires [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test
```

### Publish as single-file .exe

```bash
dotnet publish SyncthingPause/SyncthingPause.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

Output: `SyncthingPause/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/SyncthingPause.exe`
